# Insert path of script below at setwd()
# The GSE120575_Sade_Feldman_melanoma_single_cells_TPM_GEO.txt file has to be downloaded from GEO (due to size). 
# Then unzip this file and place into input/raw folder. Then delete the first empty column/row entry. Then begin script.
# There is an easy entry point starting directly with the CD8T cells (find readRDS(sce_CD8T.rds))
