# Tex_SNX9_Manuscript_Deposition
Deposition of Data Analysis of Tex SNX9 manuscript by Trefny et al. for publication in Nature Communications.

This repository consists of three separate analyses grouped into folders. Each contain the R scripts and necessary input files. Note that due to large file sizes, some input files are required to be obtained through the linked GEO repository (see README for each analysis). The folders also contain output files and plots, which were used to generate the manuscripts figures.
