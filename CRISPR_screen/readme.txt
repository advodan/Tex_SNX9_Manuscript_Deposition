This folder contains the CRISPR screen analysis pipeline. 
Starts from counts of guides per sample generated via the PinAPLpy online platform. 
Then generates log 2 fold change values for each guide between functional and dysfunctional samples per donor. 
Also provides averaged log 2 fold changes for each gene per donor replicate. These have then been used in Prism to generate the manuscript's figures.
